### ‚ùó Important
about it directly in [here!](https://github.com/urizudev/onix-nuker)
> **WARNING:** Many people have been selling/distributing infected versions of Onix Nuker.
> **DO NOT** install Onix Nuker from any place other than this page. If you install it from somewhere else, expect to be **Hacked/Scammed.**

## ü§ì Dear Skids
**Good for you,** you decided to skid something. <br>
We can't stop you, but just know you're pathetic. <br>
<br>
I hope you end up on the streets begging for spare change.

## Installation 


#### Source Code Version (More complicated but less buggy)
```sh-session
Click the green "Code" button.
Click "Download ZIP"
Extract the ZIP to a folder.

Run setup.bat, which will install all dependencies and open the script.
After that, every time you'd like to use Onix, simply open start.bat

NOTE: Make sure you have Python 3.9.5 or above installed from python.org (NOT MICROSOFT) & added to path.
```
